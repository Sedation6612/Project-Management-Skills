# Research Notes: AI Engineering & Clawdbot (Access-Limited)

## Access Status
External web access is currently blocked by a 403 proxy response, so I could not retrieve live documentation (including Clawdbot docs). Attempted example:

```
$ curl -I https://example.com
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

```

## Evidence-Based (General) AI Engineering Practices
The following are standard, widely accepted practices for engineering AI systems when external docs are unavailable:

1. **Define explicit objectives & safety boundaries**
   - Clearly define success criteria, constraints, and stop-work rules up front.

2. **Evaluation-first development**
   - Build test cases and checklists before expanding capabilities.
   - Use regression checks for prompt changes.

3. **Structured memory & logging**
   - Keep verbose logs for traceability while storing concise memory summaries.
   - Establish a single source of truth for state.

4. **Agent orchestration and tool discipline**
   - Enforce gate-based workflows (intake → ID → charter → conflicts → plan → execute → verify).
   - Require explicit validation before execution of high-risk steps.

5. **Risk-based routing**
   - Define severity levels and escalation rules in advance.
   - Route critical or blocking conflicts to a human decision point.

## Clawdbot Documentation (Pending)
Once documentation is accessible, verify:
- Boot order and runtime memory semantics
- Any existing “project” or “task” lifecycle semantics
- Built-in logging and conflict routing behavior
- Supported sub-agent or delegation mechanisms

## Skill-Specific Recommendations (Based on Current Repo)
- Keep the **Charter Lite** as the default intake and only expand to full charter when risk increases.
- Continue using a single `LOG_CACHES.md` as the verbose source of truth and reference it from memory.
- Use the minimal intake template to reduce user friction while still preserving governance gates.
