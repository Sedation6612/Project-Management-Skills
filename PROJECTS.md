# Project Registry (Cache Index)

All project records in this file must be **verbose and detailed** (context, scope notes, and decisions as applicable). Add concise references in `~/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md`.

## Project ID Standard
`OC-YYYYMMDD-####`

## Active Project Focus (exactly one)
- **Active Project ID:** OC-YYYYMMDD-0001
- **Project Name:** Kernel Governance OS (Master)
- **Charter Link:** See `CHARTERS.md`

## Registry
| Project ID | Project Name | Status | Charter | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OC-YYYYMMDD-0001 | Kernel Governance OS (Master) | Active | CHARTERS.md#oc-yyyymmdd-0001-—-kernel-governance-os-master | Seed record |

## How to Create a Project
1. Generate the next Project ID using the standard format.
2. Write the charter into `CHARTERS.md` using the required template.
3. Register the project in the table above.
4. Log the creation in `LOG.md`.

## Optional Project Creation Rule
- If the master did not request a project, ask whether the request should become one with a specialized sub-agent.
- If the master declines, proceed as non-project work and record the categorization in `LOG.md` and `MEMORY.md`.
