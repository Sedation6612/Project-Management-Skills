# Project Management Skills (Markdown-Only)

This repository provides **Project Management Skills**, a **Markdown-only skill** that implements a governed “Operating System” for OpenClaw: mandatory Project IDs, a User Project (kernel), charter-first workflow, conflict detection + logging, severity levels, and safety-over-speed execution. It also **integrates with OpenClaw runtime workspace files** by instructing OpenClaw how to read/write them at boot and when learning or remembering. The project management skill does not include BOOT/AGENTS/SOUL/TOOLS/HEARTBEAT; it instructs OpenClaw how to update them in its workspace.
