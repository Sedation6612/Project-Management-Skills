# Charters (Cache)

# OC-YYYYMMDD-0001 — Kernel Governance OS (Master)

## Objective
Define and enforce the governance OS for all OpenClaw projects.

## Scope (In)
- Project ID enforcement
- Charter-first workflow
- Conflict detection and logging
- Severity mapping and escalation
- Runtime integration with workspace templates

## Scope (Out)
- Project-specific delivery beyond governance scope
- Bypassing gates or severity handling

## Guardrails
- Safety and correctness are primary.
- Stop-work rules are mandatory.
- Overrides require written records.

## Dependencies
- `PROJECTS.md`, `CONFLICTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `LOG.md`
- OpenClaw workspace templates (external to this repo)

## Success Criteria
- All work is tied to a Project ID.
- All projects have charters.
- Conflicts are logged and routed.

## Verification Plan
- Audit logs for Project ID usage.
- Check `CONFLICTS.md` for proper routing.

## Non-Goals
- Business-specific delivery requirements.

## Change Control
- All changes recorded in `DECISIONS.md`.
